# Snake-AI

In this project I created a Snake AI that implemented the BFS and A* algorithms to find the shortest path from the head of the Snake to the apple using Java on Eclipse

# Rules:
The board has 4 snakes each competing for one apple  
The board has 3 obstacles each round  
The more apples a snake eats the longer it grows and the more points it earns  
There are also points for killing other snakes  
The apple also rots over time and the longer the snakes take to eat it the less points they earn and if they take too long the apple becomes poisonous 

# To run the game on Eclipse:

Right click on the project and select Run As -> Run Configurations.. | 
Then, double click on Java Application | 
In the Main tab,  click the Search button, and Select "MyAgent (default package) | 
Then click on the Arguments tab and enter "-develop" into the Program Arguments box | 
Hit "Apply"

I have also uploaded a video demo of the game
